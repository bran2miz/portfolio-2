## Retrospective

1. What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
  This assignment went particularly well! I really enjoy using trello, and the task manager really makes you extremely organized with the way I tackled each task.
What did I learn today?
  Using trello, having the option to switch languages.
What should I do differently next time?
  I want to add another language! I took Japanese in college, so I would like to add it to the secondary languages.
What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
  The lab today was pretty straight forward so I don't have any puzzling issues.
Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
  I finished the assignment!
